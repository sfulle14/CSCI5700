# VR Mechatronics

## Introduction of Project
The purpose of this project was to work on developing a VR game that can be used by a research group at Vanderbilt University to measure the interaction of Autistic and Neurotypical people. 
This was a Leader-Follower game so there would be a leader who can see a scematic of the Arduino and pseudo code for the Arduino code that they would use to try and explain how the follower should wire the Arduino and code the Arduino.
The Follower would then see an Arduino interface that they could wire up to 2 LEDs. These LEDs would then blink at different frequencies if they were wired correctly.
There was then the Drag-and-Drop Arduino code section that the follower would interact with to try and drag the code in the proper place based on what the leader was telling them. 

## Dependencies
Unity version 2022.3.9f1 or later  
C# for modifying the codebase  

## User Guide  
### User Interface

### Arduino

### Drag-and-Drop code


## Future development  
Finishing the validation of the Arduino wiring.  
Connecting the Drag-and-Drop code validation button to the UI asking the user what to do if there is an error.  
Cleaning up the look of the UI.
