# CSCI4700
 VR team building activity

This branch is handling the user interface from the leader perspective using a web browser connection.

How to run
In the Visual Studio Code editor, open a new terminal. 
Navigate to the directory web_comms and enter the command npm run devStart 
Then, using two browser windows, open a page to localhost:5123 in the web address bar at the top.
The page will ask permission to use your camera to display an image of yourself in the bottom corner.
(5123 is the port number i decided to use to test the webpage. It can changed to a different port number in the code.)
